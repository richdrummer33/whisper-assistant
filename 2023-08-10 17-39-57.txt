you know, specifically in terms of like this predicament. So like if I zoom out and kind of summarize what I was just talking about like the build was broken for longer than we should have let it be broken and it was also broken in ways that we didn't know about for too long. How do you fix that? Well, I've I basically have two points like when I was right now notes there are really just two things that stuck out to me because as I started thinking about other problems, I realized that the two things that stuck out to me would would have kind of solved all the other sort of little problems. And the the first one so after I finish this I'm curious to hear everybody else's thoughts but I do just want to get this out of the way. Like you wrote here and crease stability passes back to the schedule and yeah the two the two action items that you have underneath milestone delivery failure are basically my two points. So the first one is I felt like it was a happy accident that that Dylan you were we were all hands on deck and and we were like well what's what are you gonna do Dylan and then and then we had you you know just kind of being like on demand testing. So when something was finished or a bug was finished I could I could say like hey test this and you'd be like cool that's my job right now and you just test it and they give me the thumbs up or whatever and that made it really easy for me to like move through the tasks that I was doing but also your second pair of eyes made it so that there was less ambiguity about what that about that bug being solved. Instead of me fixing a bug and then trusting that like I was going to you know instead of getting a thumbs up for me and everybody being like okay great the bug solved it's like no we need a second pair of eyes to look at that bug I think to make sure that it's actually solved and I think this is just something that we should actually build into our our day to day schedule it'd be kind of a big change and I don't know how far we want to take it but in my mind I was almost thinking of having like a like a review channel but for play testing like a play test request channel where when you're finished with a task like say a Trello card that is encompassing a certain amount of tasks or you know a big task on a checklist or something that that basically just needs where you're like I'm done with this thing and ready to move on to the next thing when you're done with that current thing saying like in the review channel I'm I just finished this I would like somebody to take a look at it and then somebody can volunteer to to play it and give you some feedback and I think this would help me a lot because I feel like the person volunteering a lot of the time would probably be me because I realize that I just have so many plates spinning that a lot of the bugs were surprises to me because I just actually didn't know I didn't know when bugs were introduced because so many people were working on so many things that I had already worked on that were fine when I worked on them but then you know an artist would come in like Daniel you worked on the Gilbert cars in car test room and put the arms on them which is really cool and I was just like oh this this looks really great but the next time I went back to actually look at it I realized that the the nav mesh agents were behaving differently and causing timing differences from the you know physics that I that I put in there and that's no fault of yours I should have gone in review to after you posted that thing just to make sure that everything was cool because there's so many moving parts literally and it just didn't really like I just didn't really like have the time but I think putting intention into it and being like basically like alerting a learning putting something out there like a signal out there and going like hey I would like this to be looked at and that way I can have the opportunity or anybody else who's involved with the scene or wants to know or just have free time can just be like oh cool like I'll take a look at it for you and I just think you would help awareness of bugs like a long time before they happen because if art was put into a scene and then you say like hey I put art into the scene can you come take a look at it then I could go in and actually fix all the bugs that happen but inevitably happen when when like art is put into a scene I've come to realize and that's the art is just one example but that is my thought on that it's like some sort of systemized way to request a playtest from I mean I think I think this is probably implicitly what you're saying but I think that giving more time to scenes also means specifically more time for the person who's kind of owning that scene at the time to do more testing themselves as well. Yes and that's actually a separate thing like the the that was the first point of my two major points is like having some systemized way of being like we need to review for for myself it would be very helpful to be able to see which other working on and tackle things earlier and just have awareness and that would help with my awareness. The second thing is when I was working on training for recently the most recent scene that I've made I was kind of at this like it's working but there's clearly bugs point and normally I would have been like this is good enough I'm going to move on because that's just the speed that we're working at and then Graham jumped on the on was on the meeting and he was like because me and all we were on the same page there and Graham was like no I think you did an extra day on it and I was like for real like I was I was kind of like pleasantly surprised and I was kind of like waiting for you all either be like no we don't have time for that but nobody said anything so I was like okay I'll take an extra day on it and that extra day was massive like it was like um if I look at extra leg room on like a 14 hour flight or something you know like it just it just like gave me four of the room yeah yeah you feel like that that um that was on the this kind of brings brings up something that we'll talk about later too which is it like at that point when he said that you know it was already on the schedule that there was an extra day there but I don't think there was any awareness about it and I think a lot of time like my communication I got an effective enough when it comes to that awareness hey yeah anything you're about to say something yeah go ahead to them no yeah I just think that I think I I I think hearing you say that that felt like a lot of extra leg room yeah like I guess just like especially for these kind of larger scenes and in the early stages I definitely think like yeah I mean I think that also like could have helped like car test room instead of like having to like deliver so quickly just like kind of just having some more time to just like sink your feet in and just like you know just feel work it until it's like feeling good rather than just like wanting to deliver so quickly you know like yeah because a lot with a lot of those like big gameplay moments it's like you know yeah you got to you got to live in it a little bit and like kind of you know and then then the great idea and then you know we'll come to you I don't know just like it that no I think that's right what I've observed a lot of is like people are you know because of the perceived need to go fast both testing and doing content creation kind of in an overlapping way when really the way it should be is like you get that scene to a good place and maybe you can even put it on the review channel but there needs to be time built in where you can just say confidently like yeah I played it a couple times did different pathways and it's not broken in any kind of easily identifiable way yeah yeah and then the other thing that extra day gave me was time to work on camera stuff which I feel like was also major painful part of the the cure build yeah and so I was able to actually like make the camera work the way that I wanted it to in there I was able to put make sure that there was um I had time to give it to you guys and then grandma was like oh can you put more time in here's the Daniel can like have more space to do animation so it's closer to what it actually will be and I was like oh yeah of course and I had an extra data like add all those notes in and just make it so that it felt ready to be passed on to the next person instead of like having all these loose ends that made it so I would I would know maybe what's up with the scene and maybe there's like a trail of car bury somewhere that has like all the notes on the scene but somebody playing it would just encounter it and be like what's the problem here like that I feel like is what happened with so many scenes and yeah I think you you almost kind of intuitive the next thing on this list which is like I think train for was a good case study and that's kind of applying some of the lessons we learned through that one aspect of the milestone failure of let me just read from your leaving scenes in legible and coherent states before hand off so completions because yet that was you know the two big things that that got us failed were bugs and things being illegible and and coherent and I think that like so when you did train for recently all that explainer text is in there so that when you hand it off to Daniel or even if it gets completed it winds up being available before it gets arted it makes sense and it's not a kind of you know you're inherently confusing thing for a player or a team member to experience and it's not like playing that scene you then need to go in the script and cross reference and do like what is supposed to be happening here those those filling in the blanks that has to be like more part of our process when we're building scenes and I know that's something we went over throughout the cure build process but it's definitely something I want to carry on as we just go forward for the rest of development and it's another thing that kind of means we need to take a little bit longer in certain scenes. Yes I think every scene could probably leave a little bit more time because I think with the curvil taught us was that if you don't spend the time up front it's going to come back later so if we run out of time on scenes I think that's when we just fast the question of like we should be asking questions about like how important blank is for the scene not just leaving it undone like it should it should be done even if it's less than it should be do that makes sense so that's like that's where my heads at that's that's pretty much all I had to share interesting to hear other people's thoughts. We've got up the camera system and something I observed a lot was just like that being this constant source of something's broken or somehow it's making all the text go wobbly and just seeing like a lot of time was sunk into kind of just maintaining how the camera was behaving. Are we feeling like that has been overcome or does there need to be some kind of a rethink and how that's handled? I want to say that that it's not like I think overcome is the wrong word but I think that Kenny and I have worked out like yesterday I talked with Kenny about how I got the camera doing it stuff in train four and just you know wanted to compare notes and stuff and I think that like I think that I feel confident that going forward like will have a more consistent like camera features and stuff because it was it was a mixture of things it was like the redical and then it was also just like the camera locking when it wasn't supposed to or like using different systems to lock the camera that were overlapping and I think we're just like weeding things out and so yeah Kenny and I talked about it how we're going to because I think Graham you said that you wanted to have like the camera passes done as part of the first pass and so that's what I do for train four and I feel like that was a really good idea going forward. Yeah I think it's I think so I think that that is I'm pretty happy with that solution I'm just like dealing with camera stuff beforehand and not like dealing with it after words because that was kind of a mess. I think the camera now anybody's like of that chunk of conversation just now did anybody have anything his mind mind that's relevant to that stuff. Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. I have liked Kenny's general inclination to globalized systems rather than the kind of one-off approach that we were using that kind of you know was like kind of a I guess a testing them of like the rapid approach and so yeah I definitely have appreciated that general just going towards and like I feel the same kind of like the HEC system like every HEC has a different need but that's just an example of a system where I feel like it could benefit from like a kind of global you know uh congruity or whatever testing yeah that's an interesting topic hey hey yeah okay I was muted that's why okay got it that muted sorry I'm a Mike's all messed up um sorry I didn't interrupt you interrupt you if you were finishing your thoughts was you can say like I think I've heard a lot of people talk about like the value of that on the flip side I think I've also heard people talk about how global systems and automated systems can kind of introduce bugs in places where we don't want them to crop up like with the radical behavior for instance and remember you Kenny talking about wanting to just go to a manual load for certain scenes on the radical that's yeah I guess harder to mix those bugs. Yeah I guess I didn't mean like a global system but more like a global like language like a global way of doing that like we shouldn't have four different ways to do the same thing with the camera you know like we should do that and like you know but yeah I'm not totally in the engineering point so I don't know what is in isn't possible or completely this is by the way like the biggest um like philosophical conundrum that I have when working on video games period but this game is especially just because end by because of how just because like you know we'll make something work and it'll be good and we'll be like oh these cameras are great like they work every like they're working so well and then like it's part of our process I'm not trying to throw anybody into the bus but Graham will come it if you like and be like oh we need to actually focus on like in train for it's like oh we actually need to like focus on the the last final heavy object after you've opened your eyes and the trains pass underneath like we need to focus and vignette on that as it falls so that it's like one coherent sort of like moment from when you open your eyes to when it crashes down I'm like okay that's cool so we got so there's all these factors that have to go into that to make that work and that is just one time probably that will happen like that might not happen anywhere else in the game and so if we made a global system that did that we'd be completely wasting our time so like those are the kinds of things that I think about you know where it makes you just about organizing it more than just to be like yeah that one that that one object is specifically for this case you know like having it documented more clearly there probably might be cases where that needs to be the like I mean because it seems like what the camera is looking at on eyes open like I guess the idea is like when you're in the train and you close your eyes on items it's kind of stays locked to the train normally the camera so when you open your eyes the camera is like chilling on the train normally or what is it doing it chills on the thing that you just looked at so you looked at it actually you'd be looking at the object so what was different about that one well like you wanted to have been yet and you wanted you wanted to then yet and like a zoom on it and we currently have a system that like built into the interactual object that focuses on the train that focuses on the thing that you're lifting up into the air so that's that's globalized like that all you got to do is drop it and you'll do that yes that's globalized but it zooming in and then staying looking at it as it falls is not so right I'm left with the conundrum of okay so do I incorporate do I fold this into the globalized system so that's an option that you can use which will take extra time to make sure other things don't break or do I just use it one off for this because you know and then down the road we might go oh this actually works really well this looks great and then before we know what we've done one off and like you know five more scenes before you realize like we should just globalized it and so like that's that is the conundrum you know it's like I agree to look like you made the right call in that situation and that example right because all at that time the only thing you could have known is that well is a one off you know unless the team was talking about making it I think right where you're right then you're just prototype all right there's no crystal ball yeah there's no crystal ball that's it that's how us like when to make something into a globalized system because doing that too much introduces it makes things to complexity and rigid we we are we are just we have a different kind of rule set and I'm trying to figure out I've been I really try and figure out ways to like embrace the unique way that we do stuff and I think I I think I'm coming to the conclusion that lots of what we ease ease of use I think about the history ease of use and flexibility are like probably the two most important things I think that I've that I've come to want out of out of the tools and workflow but what that requires is probably what that requires is just is your right Dylan is like a lot of organization because that means we have lots of pieces that can fit into each other when needed but you have to know where those pieces are the the challenges behind that is that sometimes with that with that flexibility you with you build systems to cover the common stuff and then flexibility allows you to kind of poke at the system it allows you to tweak the cars engine you know what I mean for those specific moments and and the more you're able to tweak the more potential there is for things to not work that way you want them to but it's that and that's the balance you're trying to strike right so it's it's it's kind of like that's kind of how I think about it in that way yeah and actually it's one to step back because I didn't get a chance to comment about the viewer mentioning Bella about the you know it's taking more time in the scenes and I can't say I can't agree more I do feel that we move at a very fast pace and I think we're producing really really good stuff at the same time I can see I'm constantly like finding myself kind of like almost wanting to reach back and grab that thing that's that I that I had to let go of kind of thing because I'm like you know that that system didn't get enough time for me to to really make it work well or to really be sure that everything is like golden you know and it take that extra time to to really be thorough because of the the pace at which which he moved and and having to shift priorities to make sure that people can keep working on their on their stuff so you know to me it wasn't really a surprise when things like the reticle didn't work or you know when there was bugs like like pro blockers is not you didn't really surprise me because kind of just as we were going through because I see the systems like I mean I'm building those like lower level systems so I see them inside and out and I know like I know there are parts where there's work that has kind of been needed to kind of just re look go through the code because like there have been bugs that are shown up and we haven't had a chance to deal with them or just the systems are more complex than they need to be because we once were doing prototyping and and then we just left it that way because it's like it kind of worked but it was still there were still two men moving parts which meant that when we're implementing with those systems it's there's more room for error the way when you implement them there's more more more toggles that you can switch like think about the interactable object for example you know stuff like that so like you know there's those things and slowing down and my dad likes to use a comment a quote called slow as fast where it's like you know you're pacing yourself kind of thing but yeah the nice thing about moving slow is that you get the foresight because you're like actually you know what we're in a really good place we can actually speed up now and that's kind of like how I think about slow as fast even though my nature is I like to move quickly but I don't at the same time you know what I mean yeah you know I think that's definitely kind of a recurring theme in this conversation and you know on the flip side error who what he says like you know gas will fill a room no matter how big it is so meaning like whatever time you a lot like you're gonna go right up to the edge of it and I think like he to kind of remedying that is backtering in that time of thorough testing and just sort of helped and safety check on the scene that you're working on or the sort of feature that you're working on and then communication because like with you saying that it's not a surprise when the radical stuff is broken like that that tracks with me but for me it's like I know no no no sort of you can come forward or whoever can come forward and say like you know I moved on from this thing for the schedule or for discussions of another feature request I have a feeling though that it could be liable to completely break or the radical be missing for a few scenes kind of a thing it just it's I don't have confidence on it no that's more in retrospect I meant in retrospect because yeah I mean sure going forward that's a lesson that we could take from this in a way just sort of flagging like hey I moved on but I'm not feeling confident on this thing it doesn't feel like thoroughly checked enough I think it needs time for that like communicating about where we feel like we are under budgeting the time or something that could manifest as a big bug yeah that's right and yeah it's right so like and also kind of on the note of when we catch those issues like like you mentioned I think maybe it was Ubella or Oli about when you're playing the scene and you're like oh there's this one bug like it just showed up and you didn't reproduce it again so you might be just be like oh whatever just don't want off and I was feeling and I'm like oh maybe maybe what we need to do is actually make that a priority to flag those things and say oh yeah I got this like you know I was just playing this build one off and you know it just came across this issue every set the scene it was gone or whatever even though it just happened once making that a more of a priority to address rather than kind of secondary like saying oh we'll get back to it I think is important because that's it yeah and logging that somehow whether it's a slack message just to announce it or to Trello card and the Trello kind of housekeeping is one of the things on this list too that can be improved for sure and that's something I want to lend a lot more support to right yeah and then maybe we can be preserving a certain amount of time per week to kind of address that that card let's say that kind of ongoing like oh we're running into this thing right into that thing sort of thing where you just you reserve the time so it's so what you don't have to think about it because I feel like being a like in your in your shoes all like you probably have a lot of what's what we call like mental it's like a burden of decision making you can add up a lot and having to plan for all of the unknowns is hard so like sometimes just like scheduling at a time where you don't have to think about it's always there can help alleviate some of that burden yeah sure I think factoring that into the schedule just for us to just sort of verify that that thing's doing smoothly and and nothing I wanted to ask just to the team in general was like are there systems or features that are just kind of breaking on a recurring basis and causing a lot of trouble and and taking up a lot of our time that we just wish were more stable maybe maybe no but that's something I was curious about just based on what I've been observing that's a good question I can't think of any of the top my head I don't know about anybody else seems like audio stops working a lot in a kind of oh yeah why there you have that's true is there anything you can do about that over current is it is it par the course or is there something we can do to kind of give it its time to do that health and safety check well last time what was it like the thing had just been deleted out of basing yeah and I couldn't really figure out why but I but me and my fixed it then it was fine so I think like yeah no we always to do that yeah I feel like I can relatively like I run here that happens I'm done here whatever anyone thinks and I've also a couple of wise that's that I have I think we'd be what could be good because you know working on the system side and having seen some of these issues like the one you just mentioned it just had at the time had in cross my mind but that wise object and deleted like I'm actually when you open up a scene I have these editor scripts that do checks on those scenes that whenever you open a scene in unity it like says hey are you the basing if so check that you have this on I don't know something like that I'm making this well yeah because I also think a recent problem that we had where we couldn't hear stuff was because of like a pro like a script that had changed it right remember like the I forgot what it was script that changed something there was some like an interplay mode option or something that had stopped audio from working so like that wasn't me oh yeah that's right that was just like a player's anything yeah I announced which that thing on and off like daily just to make sure that that it's not causing problems but but so yeah I mean I feel like that that is a really good point though when it comes to the wise issues it's usually not it's usually a proper work work that I I taking a box somewhere and I think we have a pretty once and once we find that box like it just gets added to the list of things that you just checked when why stops working yeah so I don't feel like it's a huge problem because it's not like it happens every day and so I don't really know I don't really know what else there is to say about it but like that that's kind of there is a it's not true there is a Odin validator does things where like the Odin validator can tell you things about your scene at least and say like hey there's a you set this rule which meant this thing had to be enabled in these states or whatever it'll actually flag it and put a warning for you so you can catch those things more usually like there's things that we can do like if we come up with cases where we keep hitting our heads against the wall and yeah so that's one thing and then another thing might be that the like the settings for wise are actually stored in a like a scriptable object or some kind of asset and maybe just running a check on that and then giving you a warning if something's changed or is not where the way that was that it should be set that could be done as well so that way at least you have a little bit of feedback that's a relatively good idea um I think that that could work um yeah because it yeah because we don't share the wise unity settings or whatever and I think if somebody has the like global object thing ticked in the base in their settings and I think it like deleted it from the base scene or something I don't know um it would be yeah it would be cool to just figure out how to make nothing in in the wise section of the base scene change ever like can we just lock all that shit down somehow like uh not really because if it gets removed if like let's let's say it gets deleted automatically by some script well the script really justly and if you save the scene now it's gone um but what a like an editor script might do is like I run this editor script to do check some of the base scene and um and it just happens automatically when you load the scene and when you unload the scene in editor mode not in play mode but it could do it in both but so in that so we have to you know it could like let's say you save the scene and that object's missing it could recognize that the object's missing and and then warn you or flag you or just prevent it from happening and just read it you know by the way well yes we're talking about wise just one other thing I can use is just further um further divide like the sound banks to lead to quicker holes with sound banks if that seems useful to you guys if it's not an issue then we can just continue as we are but um yeah also if anyone else has any thoughts about wise like can you do anything then yeah I'm down to to hear anything I think for you like us putting the sound banks be good yeah cool yeah I'll probably I can prioritize that yeah so that'll it that needs to eventually happen anyway because uh pretty it probably will have to it have to you I don't say have to I mean like if you don't want to use up like all of your RAM yeah but uh and loading times it will also help loading times but the yeah I was gonna say I think that'll involve some system stuff like I think we have to we could either preload sound banks or we can like can you even let me play when we like call an event it'll be like oh that events and then it can it loads it well yeah I mean I think I I can do that all on my end I can trigger bank to load like within a specific scene and I just like pay attention to check points that we have or whatever you know just yeah let's get make those all go that's good here cool um I'm curious to hear Daniel or I I mean I'll leave this as all right with your with your workflow kind of or with the flow that's meaning I just want to Daniel you you said you had some notes from like earlier we were talking to and we were like oh save them for this call so I just want to make sure we get to those yeah yeah Daniel you had um yeah so this was kind of like uh some observations I had well working on the pre-ELFA and um it's mostly just to do with art so uh but I feel like a lot more time needs to be a lot of for uh the animations in these scenes this my feel like overall this game is unique in the sense that instead of your player moving through a static space a lot of time it's the player that's static and all the objects and people in the space are moving around them um and I feel spending more time on the animations is one of the largest largest factors that can help a scene feel finished and polished um I know that animation is a time intense a process and it can be frustrating for some of us the time that takes to animate but um like I'm a fast animator like I was I was animator full time for 10 years so the time that I'm taking to do the animations is the time that it requires to do them um yeah and I think that it just needs to be emphasized in the schedule a little bit more um I think some of the favorite scenes that I'll play testers um like in the like feedback section um some of the ones that are chosen as favorites were some of the gameplay like scenes and animation heavy scenes um and I think that this is just when it comes down to it it's just like animation heavy game and I don't think there's any way around that um and so I think like moving forward just keeping in mind ways that we can kind of conserve our animation um budget a little bit and then conserve the animation budget where we can but also spending the animation budget where we need to and I've really enjoyed um the help that Kenny has lent to this in the last few days um helping to build some of the like systems at a system level um and I think going in that direction would be really beneficial. Yeah I mean that kind of syncs up with this idea of spending a little bit more time and scenes um for the sake of quality and I think that the systems that you and Kenny been making like that's something that that bellic could also incorporate if you feel good about that kind of layers of paint process Daniel and that that does make sense time budgetarily then I I love what I've seen and you know what Kenny you posted the other day of the emotions or yesterday of the emotions um you're right that it makes a big difference Daniel so I like that idea. Yeah I think Graham I'm actually sort of you know initiated this idea of getting that baseline system and yeah that that could really go a long way in terms of like feeling in that blank of those scenes so that they're not in just total like blank slate land all the way up until the kind of full on animation pass yeah thanks for bringing that up I think that that resonates. Yeah I have one one last note that I think would probably be have been better in the previous meeting but I was a little confused at what subjects were exactly um covering it and we read it I know so um but I just think that Isaac's head moves too fast in most of the scenes I think we're just I think it runs in conflict of feeling like a baby and I think the further down the road we go in designing puzzles that require Isaac's head to move very fast um the the harder it's going to be too adjusting um and I know that there is some thought that it feels better to move faster but I feel one of the edicts of the game is to feel like a baby and I think it also you know like a lot you'll want to move around but we're not laying a play around we're like imposing these kind of restrictions on the player to help emphasize a mood and like feeling and I think I think just like being able to like whip your head all around and like um it just it doesn't really feel like me but that that's uh like probably should have been. Yeah I remember you mentioned I appreciate you kind of bringing that up again. Let's let's have a look at that. I mean I do think that I think I kind of lose but in both conversations so I don't know about that but it doesn't matter about the conversations but that feels like pretty much a creative note not a process no but it's great let's talk about it but um yeah I think that the problem with it is it's just like it might even be down to subtly adjusting it based on the scene that you're in but because I agree with you however in some of these scenes that could be really frustrating like because of what we're asking the player to have to do like anything that feels you know things like train and things like car chest and things like chase you know it's just like where there's anything that's there's a timing element and you definitely don't want to make the player feel like they're fighting the camera but I I wonder if you can get away with just like adjusting it seem for seeing you know so you let it go a little faster when it's more of a gameplay scene or maybe like when the game starts and it's more about emphasizing the babyness in like the last scenes you look at it down and once he has his psychic powers and he's like you just suddenly let that kind of get freer because it's less of because it's more about him becoming freed um so I yeah be going more alien mode fast yeah baby yeah yeah yeah I remember I remember before you guys be it's like a very subtle thing but like as the as the game progresses the camera like rises off the ground slowly because you're like getting older and like yeah I remember I remember that being sort of something that we didn't really think much about like while we were making the scenes but then we were like oh we got actually do this in a rather than later because um and that's why I feel like it has actually a little bit of a process thing because um you're right like we've designed a lot of stuff that that actually makes that kind of not work very well because we weren't we didn't put it uh forefront in the process but I think that like you're you're right that we should probably do some kind of like this is a thing where I think we could do a default global setting that we're all happy with and then we can you know adjust when scenes need adjustments but yeah even the chores in bedroom can be so I feel like yeah that was those scenes with that are you know non-timing oriented like early and I mean one of the one of the reasons still is designed the way that it is is actually because I was like and in my mind I was I was making sure that everything all the puzzles were were solvable while looking 180 degrees um to either side of the front of the so stealth is stealth is designed to do that um it's just not implemented there but there's but there's like so so I think that that that that that was meant to be like a past that came after or like we were working on the tool for it and it just wasn't quite there yet so we kind of moved on you know the the thing that we were talking about um yeah I mean I think I think where a where I'm hearing like a global note here that does kind of apply across from creative to process is like and I think this is a processing and this kind of coincides nicely with also where I'm at in my process where I'm like finally locking out in the final script for like the final video session next month um but like it's feeling to me like maybe because we've just done this big sprint into all this we've done a big sprint we've gotten a lot of first passes at a lot of scenes I wonder if focusing our work on for a little bit on like take grabbing a few scenes like uh that we feel good about so maybe you know the first scene where you do your cut-pours, chores and then maybe you know a scene with the telepathy and then like and then some part of chase or something like that and the kind of doing like some of our kind of like these global creative things because I actually do agree that it's like I feel very similarly about UI and our hint system as well as like I feel like there's these conversations of like how the camera works, how does UI work, how does hinting work, how does um inputs and controls, inputs and controls and so like there are these big sections also like what are the rules of the camera and how is the camera kind of like communicating itself and I and I and I could see there an argument of us like taking a few scenes and trying to do some of that like focusing on some of that kind of stuff and even doing some AB testing where it's like you give some players one build versus you know for something like controls it's like a perfect example of something that you might want to do so AB testing on which we never have done which I feel like is probably smart to do because like we always just do this thing of like get feedback but you could do a thing where you know one set of testers play one control scheme and one set of testers play another control scheme and you can I be tested what I think would you know is it's a really great form of data and all the things critique yeah or that but like but um it's feeling to me like everyone's kind of yearning for some of these more kind of global things to get kind of creative things to be kind of like decided and I so I think that could be a really smart place to put ourselves a like let's just go ahead and figure out UI let's just go ahead and figure out uh some of these controls you know let's go ahead and figure out how fast we want the camera to move and the camera movement because it's like any like almost looking down the list of what are things in this game that apply to almost every single scene and then like trying to find a little test bed for those and kind of like locking some of those decisions down I think that could make us all feel a lot better because then we know like it's sort of like those basic things are set and then when we're designing we kind of we know more about like the rules is a you know so I feel like that would be a smart move usually usually in favor of this um yeah these have taken these have historically taken a back seat to content creation and and I think I think the reason we're all feeling this is because it's the time has gone yeah yeah it would be a nice thing before we continue to do too much more just jamming out content it's just feeling like we know how you i work we know how the game controls we know yeah these big questions yeah and and from the system side it like um i was going to bring a stop on glad you mentioned it because it was one of my points and that is like we've got a lot of so like as we've been developing the game there's been requests for systems to get built and then the game and then those systems change you know eventually change it for time and then new approaches to those to those problems get get created like for example like the camera right now how does the camera look at how does it get pulled towards a target you know and that there was one way of doing it now there's another and both the systems exist in the game and they both have different results in the way the player experiences it but also because there's two of those systems they they don't always play well um with the higher with the global systems so generally you always you know like that's why you always stick with one system for each thing that might give you that has all the knobs in it um but it's just it was just a matter of like you know priorities at the time it's like well it's working so we you know move on to the next thing at least so we thought at least usually for some cases no right so it ends up causing um we came to end up causing bugs but also yeah impacting the player experience so um one of my thoughts was that we take that uh taking time to go back and looking at all of these but like FSM actions right that are used in earlier scenes that are no longer used that we that we want to replace and actually we're doing that like replacing them and and then making that scene feel the way we want it to based on the rules you guys are we're all gonna come up with and and all that um design rules uh user experience stuff um and they kind of because I think these systems you are in the big part of that too yeah I think so and and I think the the engineering side it's it's me like working on the engineering side the goal as I see it is to build systems to uh give the the designers and implementers the the tools that they need in order to accomplish their goals without tying them down without also also in such a way that it's also it's reliable and and simple um and and also gives them a little bit flexibility uh like I'm you know that's kind of what we're trying to go for um so you know for example like the radical has been a has been like a long running conversation and so I kind of saw the radical is having a certain set of rules and that's how it has been kind of talked about it's like when we're when our camera's locked on something it turns off when we're when there's when there are interactions or or you know we want the player to know that he can do something we can turn it on or stuff like that those are kind of rules we kind of set out and now I think you're kind of getting we're kind of getting to the point of oh we're kind of hitting on the point of let's actually build let's actually like draw out what that really means what it really is how rigid are those rules are they rigid or because to me I think yeah I thought well these are the rules right and maybe I was wrong totally well I think I think I think you know the way to move on something like this would be to you know you know it's a little bit like a vertical slice like I feel like it's like looking at you know okay so what are like our candidates of like here's a handful of scenes that kind of because we're at this point where we do have I feel like one of almost every kind of scene that we're ever going to be in this game and so I think it's about kind of putting a build together or putting like a collection of scenes together that kind of encapsulate everything that we have to do in this game you know and the scenes can cut off in the middle or whatever like they don't need to be but basically kind of figuring out that sample size thing and trying to roll out changes like something like control UI, radical stuff all these big things so we can actually apply that to a set of things that easy to test it takes about 10 minutes and it takes you know it shows you everything that the game has but it's not this big giant hour and a half long build that could also introduce bugs and stuff so it's like I think it is probably I mean correct me if I'm wrong here it's about like taking a little scent like reducing what where you're work where kind of lab for this stuff to a smaller sample size of gameplay that is easier to keep stable and that just is easier to make on the fly adjustments too so that you can constantly be kind of building a little mini build I mean maybe you're just literally using the vertical the vertical slice for this and going into those scenes and doing it there maybe that's the way to do this because we probably still have that you know we have that fraction of scenes and that's really what that was yeah but just basically use finding a little lab basically to do this stuff and then also just getting a lot of testers because I think this kind of stuff is the stuff you want to be like kind of constantly testing and getting feedback on you know and seeing how people are liking it yeah it was actually going to comment on that as like just real quick sort of the play the like build test evaluate fix build test you know whatever that loop is is I feel like it might be missing a little bit of that external input like having some people yeah yeah yeah I'm I'm out more out of this conversation than you guys and that's one thing I was going to just say was I'm just like reading these questionnaires is amazing and it just feels like we need to find you know and that's kind of not all and I but like just just that should just be a much more constant thing and more conversations like this one more conversations like that you can build up a community you can build up a community of people you know and I think I think the mall like so are there at example of people friends if we need to pay them a little bit I think we have a little bit in the budget for testers so they can feel like they're compensated for their work but like we should maybe even be doing a thing where we give them Alex or some of our discord people some material and then we bring and we wash them play it and then we bring them on and chat to nothing about it I just think kind of also yeah yeah bringing yeah I also think we should I think we should get even more outside voices than the mall because I kind of feel like you know like I mean we should definitely get them again and keep getting them but it's like you know they're like homies that we should get a lot of people yeah and everybody I every bandals so yeah what time I asked them about popping on a call as well with us if we want and I think that you know of those eight people or whatever they're all well you know willing to hop on a call I think that would be a great thing to do and there's you know I'll keep doing outreach to you and also by the way if you guys have sworn like the mall like I mean like it you know it can't be hard to get people to do this if you guys have friends you know our interested in game dev and would think and would be fun I mean for some people they really do just enjoy doing this stuff and it's fun for people so like you know if you guys have friends who you think would have fun testing this and talking to us about it and filling out a questionnaire like loop a man you know yeah yeah yeah I'll think about what do I have well we're just at the hour mark now so I want to do like hopefully kind of cover a lot of ground in the next like 10 to 15 minutes so there's a couple of things on this list I want to make sure we get to yeah okay is it what's up rich oh I just have two quick points I want to throw in just just it's the last of my points I just really want to get them in so quickly on the subject of those systems going back and and cling up the systems there's a number of systems like yarn which probably should get to completely remove from the project and you'll see we're going to move on to the next one which is these periodic checkpoints I think we should be having them like every month or something I'm not maybe however frequently we all think we all agree on like kind of like this kind of meet and augmenting or automating repetitive tasks so we do a lot of dialogue implementation but there's a tool that I made which can import it for example like just starting to use those kinds of tools and play testing takes a long time and there are unity has some input recording tools so we could record our input and replay them to just you know sandy check scene stuff like that just but that's all I wanted to the last things I want to mention cool yeah I think the question that's that we should have a whole conversation about the automation on the dialogue front because definitely want to get the voices of the people doing the dialogue implementation for a center on that but let's let's book some time to do that sure cool so yeah I think one of the things on here let me just browse this with you yeah here I think with the whole cure build it kind of through us into a tizzy but the sharing of work and progress content daily on review is something that it can seem kind of cumbersome at times to share something that's half baked but I've seen with mown eyes that you know it can really help you can have the audit and say this is this is something that's you know still working progress but it can help speed up that iteration loop and just sort of keep everyone aware of what's going on in a really good way I know we talked about this on the the morning call a couple days ago or yesterday but it's always just a good thing to remind ourselves of that it really helps us move forward um there's stuff on here yeah maintaining sorry that thing sorry I was I was muted yeah I agree and I think I could definitely post it there a bit more often but I also kind of see that as slightly being at odds with the like kind of being able to sink into a scene more and like you know like Bella feeling pushed to like get a video of something that's like not ready maybe rather than just like spending more time kind of just like experimenting and getting it right or something and I don't know like with the audio yet it helps to sometimes show something but it's like you know also sometimes I do strongly feel that I need time to cook especially on the side. I'm sorry just I really disagree with with what you're saying here um those two things should absolutely not be completed because posting and review is it's not saying that it's done and it's about transparency into the process for collaboration so like the note stands that we're rushing to fast um absolutely but that should not be completed which the sharing of work and progress work. I think we're going to end up the point is that we don't move on from it until it's ready and that I think stands but in terms of the sharing of work I think more sharing is only going to be better for this whole team. I agree with you to a point but also it's like you would not want to share pages with us that you didn't have time to think about you know like there's there's a good mixture to be had. I think there are times where sharing might actually cause confusion but there are the times where it actually can be really beneficial because if you're sharing something that's incomplete to you you know what's going on. I'm not giving up you know any representation of the thing. Yeah exactly there's there's a very good that's fine and it was both with. We can all like but I think we can all we all can understand that and that could be caveat and thing. I don't see there like a lot of there's not a lot of like points wherein I've seen that go wrong I just don't I just don't know where the cases of like oh it's something was shared and it caused massive confusion or I feel like it has for me with certain systems before. Well this is this isn't this is an area where I feel very very strongly and I feel that we I almost want to make it a rule that everyone shares you know their progress every day because I think it's really important for me to have eyes on what's going on in this project and because I have to spend a lot of time writing and doing a lot of things like the more that I can just be seeing stuff and seeing how things are evolving even just so I know what's going on even if I'm not sharing notes is really really helpful. So yes my mix I want to like almost make it like at the beginning of every day we do check in and the end of every day there's check out so that aren't done on a call but you put something into the review channel and you give a little summary of what you did on the day like that was that I think would be really helpful and yeah I just I just really I don't know it's like a philosophical thing but I think that like you know one thing about being a remote studio is that like and this is something I know about from like how studios that go into an office work is like part of what's great about offices is that it's like at any point you know the director can just walk by and be like what do you work on what's that? So let me look at this and people are constantly talking and constantly looking at each other's work mid-process and I think you know it takes them getting used to I am happy to share you know if if you guys want more sharing for me I'm happy to do that too I guess think it is just that transparency like will ultimately serve this team you know and I just think I really I feel very strongly on that one I really think we should be trying to share more work in progress work you know to be frank I feel like Dylan Bella and Daniel are really good at that like they're very comfortable sharing stuff in progress and I think it really helps I always feel like I know what Bella and Daniel are doing and I feel like with you Dylan and a little bit with Kenny and Rich especially but Rich it makes more sense because he's more on the system side I often I'm like I don't know what they're doing yeah so I feel like if everyone can try to be getting up to that level of sharing in progress work that we see kind of from Bella and Daniel that would be really useful. I think I feel yeah I mean I would say that like well I'm gonna stay out of this for a bit but okay I think sometimes also there's something we said for the value in sharing something that's not like creatively there yet because sometimes that just can have unpredictable effects of sort of saying like okay yeah that's great to know that it doesn't work just like that or wait actually there's something I really like about that the caveat and just turning it more into like a snapshot or a bite size cross section yeah like you would even say like I'm not ready for feedback on this yet but here's what I've been working on you know yeah I think there was a it's not just about feedback it's also about transparency of process yeah because I think Dylan's concerned was that sharing having like sharing the actual work content itself when it's like you know a bunch of disparate pieces that haven't really been put together let's say just take speaking high level is isn't always constructive but by sharing by saying hey like I've got these disparate pieces this is where I'm at and then tomorrow I expect to be able to have them together and I can share with you a sample of it then and that's that's an update and that's what I've been trying to do more more often is at the end of my day sending an update I actually put in the unseen team but I could put in review if you guys want where it's like yep this is this is this is the state this is what I did today this is this is the state of the things this is what I'm doing tomorrow yeah I think we should actually create like a basically a checkout that happens at the end of each day because that at least it's just something that everyone just does and everyone just could have visibility on everything and I think that you know it's like you could take 10 minutes at the end of the day if you have something to share you share it if your if things are in progress you share why they're in progress or where you're at with them and I just could see that being a helpful thing and I also think it could help the morning meetings because it's like oh you go and you look at you read the checkout you're like oh okay so this you know you know and it just helps also will just help me as I'm going in and out of things to just get a staff out of where the team is at so that was something I was gonna ask to be like a establish is some kind of checkout like channel or it's done in review but just someplace where it's like this is what the day was and that where like any end of day work is shared could be useful yeah and you mentioned something that you actually mentioned if yourself about you posting some updates and like if I you be because sometimes I do feel that I don't know what's going on on your guys' end and you know if you had a weekly update and even if it was hey the weeks gone by no progress I'm like fine no make deal I'm just curious to know like maybe it's weekly yeah by weekly but like you know that kind of a thing I'd love that I think that'd be really good because it helps it's not like I need to know what I'm going to check out to just give you a snapshot of the kinds of things going on that's true you do do that actually yeah you do so I can I can I can do more of that so I hear you yeah I was just thinking more on grams and because I don't I don't hear from you very much I love to hear from you I I'm excited about what you're doing and all that too right so but but all you do you do you do fill in for that most like you know I think you you bring those things up it's just nice to hear from from you too you know yeah I'll just yeah I definitely agree there needs to be there should be more feedback for me and I'm totally for that and I can also you know adhere to that end of day check out if that is needed but as you are the same gram like you know working it being creative at night is sometimes good so sometimes I even kind of prefer to do certain creative stuff in the night and then have some have news about it in the morning so it's like right I don't necessarily feel that the solution to this is to like further regiment and like further monitor or like scrutinize a process because it's like creative processes are also personal in ways and it's like you know if you are happy with what my output has been I definitely should will continue to get feedback and give you know more feedback but I don't know you know I do see I do see the merit in like like what I said with Bell in the car test room like letting things cook letting things feel through and you know and it's like I think that I think that progress should be shown you know at least every three days I mean I'll do more than that but like you know I don't know it's like you know you see you see stories of like you know I don't know like like George Lucas to Ben Bert it's like all right I need to late lightsaber sound like come back to me and like four days or something you know it's like especially with stuff that requires heavy concepts like you're asking me to create an entire concept for something that is totally unknown and it's like I definitely need to give feedback all along that process but I also need time to do good work that is special and I can't do that if it's like you know heavily heavily bump bump bump like you know what I mean like there's there's a good balance is what I'm trying to put it across yeah I mean I I want to say that I feel split between both of you because I think that that it's helped me a lot creatively to to post stuff into review as much as I feel like I don't want to it feels like a good it feels like oh is this a good stopping point like yeah this is a good enough stopping point like I want it's a good for review but that's mostly just me being a perfectionist and it's really healthy be less of a perfectionist that's me personally that's good um and but but I but I will say that I hear what you're saying Dylan also in that like sometimes sharing stuff there really are moments where I'm just like the only thing that sharing that's gonna do is bring comments that like I know or are not like you like you know personally well it's on in the oven and you say it doesn't look like it's gonna taste good then I think that's also that's a great kind of look like in some ways I'm glad you brought up the George Lucas example because like in some ways I think it's also about us doing the best as a tiny little studio um trying to make something you know very challenging and unique on a small budget and timeline and I think that yeah you know with larger size I think can kind of become a little bit more like people um coordinating off and and doing things in that kind of safer but with us I think it helps too and if you want a caveat and be like you're not ready for feedback as Graham said that's great it could even just be something like here are the five sounds that I was just playing around with that I'm planning on like layering and doing x y and z2 but it's just almost like giving us a window into it um it's it is something that I think helps our studio in the way that we work yeah because again I like a lot of the time it's like I have any response and stuff like Daniel's post yesterday with the hand so I was like oh he's making for he's wiping progress on the hand the trusted process I'm not I sometimes I'll look at it I'll give one note or like or I'll just say it looks cool or I'll just you know it's literally for me it's about it's about being able to have a bird's eye picture of kind of like where kind of everyone's at so that it's also it's there's a meta function to it that isn't about feedbacking it's about like awareness and my meta awareness of what the what everybody is doing and then also everyone else's meta awareness of what everyone else is doing and again it's it's about it's about trying to get a little bit of that natural thing you would get that by being an in-person studio that you lose and having being a remote studio which is like just being a little more well I could just you just look over each other's computers and there they are and it's like everybody so I just think again do we don't always have to think about it as and also often like we give feedback and it's just like you can ignore the feedback if it's not time to take it on or whatever and it's like I don't know I just think it's it anyway I think we're on a agreement here I just think that it I think it should be try to share something once a day even if that's just a text update I think it's a good rule if we don't want to make it like an end-to-date check out thing I think a once a day posting of where you're at in your process would you just as again again I think it's a chance I think I think an end-to-date update is like something we can all agree on right well I mean or if we don't want it to be end-to-date because if we're working at the night or whatever I just think like a once a day update like if you don't do it at the end of the day you want to do it in whatever I mean I think whenever the end of your work day is would make sense for it like so if you take if you want to work at night and then just post it when you're done working at night or yeah that's totally fair but I just think I just think again I don't and maybe it should not be review maybe it should be its own channel because it shouldn't it's not necessarily as much about maybe review is where stuff is going when it's up for review for feedback and not another channel where it's just it's a status update and a little bit of like this is what I'm working on I just think that like that could be useful like either posting more on review because I just I'll basically all I'm saying here is is that the amount of time I feel like every day that work goes on if I'm focused on and I'm checking it in or first I feel like a lot of days pass or I know exactly what Daniel and Bella have done and I'm a little less clear on what the rest of the team have done and I'm not trying to say like oh they're the model citizens or whatever I just think they happen to post more on review and it just I just find like I like the pain I might give more of that info and like the morning meeting but I feel I feel that and agree about yeah I can do I can but I like it in a channel so it's like in one place and it can just be loved yeah that's all yeah I do I do I think that yeah good are the only thing that to add to this and I think like what you suggested is that I would love to see more updates about the script because there's been several times like quite a few times when I'm making something and then there's been a note about oh we should change this because of what you haven't seen these pages yet but we're thinking of what we're doing this this is this and it can be very frustrating to like this is incorrect because of knowledge that I don't have you know yeah so I think yeah like I think we could all um maybe all we've been of it and we're like just like all this stuff like we all know this is stuff that is in flux that is gonna change but like having more eyes like where is that more eyes are where is that I think it'll be helpful yeah I think we're in a very confusing place where it's just like documents too with us right now on the script side but I can definitely just share more like um like our outline and and then pages like I think it's that it's we're kind of like we're kind of working towards getting what will be you know hopefully we'll be you know we have we have officially you know set dates we're in the process of crafting and you know once we've done all those reports like that will really have a walk to the script more or less at least for a long time so I think that will that will get us out because I you know I certainly take uh take some of the blame on on that where yes the script process has been has been a little chaotic but I think oh and I we're finally kind of like getting out of our getting at work we're we're we're forcing ourselves to leave this sort of this stage by just locking VOD and those are gonna be those final VOS sessions are gonna be happening throughout the month of September that's gonna also be a really important time for us to like get even more I think that month of September like all in I are gonna be like two days a week at least basically fully in recordings so it'll be really good for us to like things like that end of day check out sort of like really useful for stuff like for days like that so that there's one place where you know we can look and just everyone could be like oh this is what happened today but anyway totally heard you on that on the script and I think that I'm sure I've set it before but I really think we are at that we are we are close here to kind of to to to a script lock yeah and it doesn't have to be a lock script like I I think we're all used to three-day incomplete scripts and like anything that could help like it's all very helpful to me to like yeah well I want to sense of it one thing that's coming is like this outline this is like an updated finalized outline and so and Ollie I don't know all you shared that like scene macro thing right kind of like a version of that outline um so hopefully the combo of like the scene macro on the outline we can really start to break this thing down of like you know like a detailed outline is kind of like it's kind of as good as a script in a lot of ways because it doesn't have all the dialogue filled in it doesn't have a lot of the details but it's good enough that you can kind of budget to it and you can kind of go like okay this scene should take about this amount of time and that's in to take about that amount of time and so we're hoping to really lock this outline like next Friday basically and that's basically like that'll be a great tool for all of us to have I think especially I'm like we're pretty we're pretty close to that there's still some little question marks in the text but it's also just a great production tool right because it's like okay this is the amount of scenes we have left to do um so and then once we're going to have that lock is just going to be like finishing out the dialogue passes of which you know all every scene I have like a draft one done and there's been but we keep kind of changing you know some stuff in the story trying to just figure out how to make everything make sense um it's it's the story the hell of a hell of a early game. I didn't do any fat help any favorite is here but it's like it's just like a hell of a is a baby and there's an alien and there's a lot of different things that makes sense and there's like the most the most of the most on the wheel departed that there's also a video game player and there's a player yeah yeah it's the worst of all that script is full just for Daniel especially to be able to like fully scope it just so we can really make sure that everything will get the level of you know detailed. Yeah exactly and also things can't scope down right you know it's like then that my challenge is okay how do I if that's over scoped out and you know and that we did a lot of that on before you're eyes but you can't really scope something proper like you can't cut scopes on a gown properly until you've kind of seen a full thing that's too big but if you don't know how big the thing is you don't know how like I think one of the the probably the things that's frustrating you Daniel is feeling like you don't even know what percentage of the game this represents and so it's like are we behind or we dead like you just don't know oh yeah hopefully we're gonna get closer to you know being able to provide that clarity and yeah it's I think I feel like we can taste it I feel like I've said that many times but but I really think at this point with these locked VO dates it's sort of like we're gonna we had you know this they're just we run out of road to push on these decisions so the decisions are getting made and if the story doesn't make sense in some places then oh that's a little bit easier so still we've got it at 80 percent they'll still be better than 90 percent of most video again story that I'm confident so there you go yeah I appreciate everyone's kind of generosity with their ideas here and and directness yeah I totally I'm dealing with you it's like also part of the my thing is that your work is sick and everything like I very rarely ever feel like I hear your stuff but I'm like oh hey this is off like it's not like you're it's literally just being like just a few more updates would be just awesome yeah no I appreciate that a lot and I also it's like it's a pretty small note it's not like some big issue it's just like I feel it's hard for call like I didn't make it into a bigger totally no no it's good to yeah but you're talking about the last thing on here that I want to just wrap this up with on my end because it's it's really on my head is especially going forward like Graham said like we'll be sucked into the video stuff a lot we will have that outline to help us pave the road further ahead on this schedule is getting it more like a useful tool for people that that calendar schedule and I know that like I share the screenshots of it when we have those daily check-ins but I think that you know obviously the schedules and flux and schedules are supposed to be in flux but what they aren't supposed to be is like they're not supposed to be static like we perfectly stick to a schedule all the time but they're really not supposed to be static in a way where the schedules just always inaccurate it's supposed to be in flux so that it's updating based on what people are doing and there's a communication flow from people to me being like oh I need more time on this and so I think yeah on Monday is you know instead of just having that screenshot and kind of breezing through it will kind of just actually talk it out and you know I know we do that sometimes but talk it out a little bit more in a emphasized way and an affirmed way and I can start adding people's personal emails to those counter events if we want but just it's going to help us a lot going forward so I'm going to try and just really stick to kind of banging that drum more often and making sure that what I put in this calendar actually is logical and makes sense and it's in line with what other people think the priorities are and such so I'll be kind of paying people more frequently on that cool the other things on this list I think we can you know I can I can sort of huddle up in smaller configurations of this group and just talk to people about them as they kind of are relevant to certain people and not others so I'll do that with the rest of these things. Yeah and as far as action items go for like how to improve our workflow and we toss around a lot of ideas like grand was saying I think there's some things that kind of stuck out to me that I think are worth doing but how how should we if anybody have ideas about how to choose which ones to do and how to implement them I'm all ears on that I'm happy to also just make decisions and then present them and then we can. Well I think we should sort of go like we did last time with this call like take all these action items put them in this somewhere there's like this take away his actions section and then I'll put them on site and we can talk through them maybe on a morning call and be like are we doing this are we explicitly contradicting this in any way in terms of the explicit stuff that grand brought up about you know taking the time to implement some of these global things like input controls camera stuff, radical stuff, UI stuff that's already on the calendar I think but it's like in a week or two and I think you know what's really clear from this is that we should just do that stuff sooner so maybe it's about like waiting on the chase stuff that we just talked about with Daniel and Graham and Bella and just prioritizing the way I think that's maybe waiting on train for and prioritizing you know three times if you yeah yeah on the day you'll see a UI path and yeah and I'm on that and like on on global camera animation stuff or anything that feels a little more like better so I can take those things and put them into the calendar and the flow yeah I think that's I think that's a pretty major thing we got to this conversation is that we need to take care of those things sooner of them later I'm very happy that we got there yeah it's very valuable to hear everybody's kind of assessment of things yeah because it's you know some of the stuff you said they're Daniel about animation I think is really pertinent and like to how we schedule and budget some of this stuff going forward so put a pin in that because I think we should do a call you know where we just are kind of talking through our art budget and our art schedule call soon because that also there's definitely a lot to do with what we're kind of asking sky skybound for and what this push is going to look like and just making sure that you're happy or at least semi-happy with where we're at and feel like you know I think that getting you this outline and maybe you know hopefully by the end of you know maybe next week you could like read we can read this outline and we can just start the process of you know putting on our kind of our director budget schedule hats of like okay this is actually here you know I can actually give you something you can actually for the first time really teach her size too and being like okay does this feel like this kind of make sense because I definitely want to make sure that you're not feeling like what we're doing is impossible or we're putting way too much way on your shoulders animation wise and so it now's a really good time for like you mean all I should maybe on Monday or something once you've maybe I can send you this outline thing we should have like a kind of like animation in art budget conversation I think and it's that that's really important for me and all these to get that info out of you and make sure you're feeling good about that but as we continue to talk with Scott about yeah for sure I think that's a great idea and on the subject of scheduling and and it's coping and planning as you all know it's very hard to estimate things and for sure like for me one of my one of my probably the hardest things that I find is is get estimating time how long things will take like for example the like scene restore tool was like you know how we have the you know the the save restore system shot yeah it's now shot to all yeah like we have that we have basically a semblance of that working in the scene so I and when you look at it if you're looking at it from a first time never having done this before kind of perspective it looks like oh well all we got to do save that stuff to to disk and then you realize and then you go into it and realize oh my god there's just so much that I didn't realize is needed and there's not very much documentation. Scoping stuff like that is hard the most things aren't quite as hard a cinema machine for example making a mistake. It seems simple and it is like like the algorithm itself is one little is one kind of small function well I wouldn't say small small but it's not really that small but the the way you do aim is just like algorithmically is one thing but then integrating it into a cinema machine isn't entirely different and I'd never done anything like it before it didn't realize you know oh gosh cinema machine needs me to to interact to interact with it in a very special way and that took maybe like upwards of like a day just to kind of figure it out and get it work. So like by one thing that came to mind was for things that are I like things that I've done before it's a lot easier to scope and get estimates on things that are much more complex it actually takes time like scoping and estimating actually takes effort it's sort of like you actually kind of have to go away and do a little bit of reading a little bit of research kind of block out all the all the all the knowns and all the unknowns and then kind of start slapping like estimates on there and then come back because I often find myself kind of thinking oh I should I I just need to give an estimate I'll do my best and throw it out there and that's on me but so I just think I think that yeah I appreciate you mention that and I think just to kind of put a bow on it like that is something where it goes for everyone but especially with like systems and features when we're doing that kind of t-shirt sizing on a call or bidding as some studios call it when we're estimating how long we think something's going to take you know statistically we everyone know everything always takes long and you think it will but I think statistically we just have been too conservative I guess is the right word you know too small in our estimates basically consistently on a lot of things especially on the kind of like system side things so we got to get it in the habit of yeah maybe it means oh I can't keep an estimate right now but in an hour I'll be able to give an estimate and if it's something where it's like this could be just a really big week it just unknown this could take weeks then we have to think about whether we really need it or we have to look for a different solution right or or like it's really unknown and you don't know if it takes days or it takes weeks there's cases like that where you think it might even just take a day put it actually could be weeks like yeah it just trist this happens and I've seen it happen as an engineer like it's it's not uncommon but like just from my experience but what what I where kind of wanted to go with this was you've got a schedule and and in that schedule you want to slot in these these features and or think like you know tasks to do if we if we kind of take a moment to to look at that schedule and then look at each of those tasks and say okay well how much time each of those things really gonna take and then that will allow you to be able to plan more effectively so if we actually make it sort of like a task like you know put it on the Trello like scope or you know build estimates for yeah I don't want to run on on at totally you're getting on it goes back to something from the beginning of this call about like some of the decisions that were made leading up to us failing on the milestone we're like let's go for it on features that we actually should have said we don't need it so I totally have or that they can wait I look forward they can wait so yeah let's do that cool did anybody have anything like super pressing that didn't that didn't make the cut right now or do we feel say shaded I said everything come on to see yeah yeah definitely appreciate everyone kind of being generous with their thoughts that was great except for you can't even remember you saying too much but I'll say that is a good thing yeah yeah I'm just everything's okay I'm just I'm just messing around great well thanks guys a lot of really important stuff talked about that I'm very happy yeah and some of this stuff you know it goes immediately to our work right now so I will kind of get on slack and send an update us to what seems to be you know the intuitive thing that everyone would expect just getting codified yeah if you tell me as needed all these to help you you know I'm available all right thanks everyone
