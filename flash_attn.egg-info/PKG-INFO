# whisper-assistant

This is a python script using [openai/whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to type with your voice.
After you start the script you just press **F2** to start/stop recording. After the record is finsihed, it will type what you said starting at the current cursor position in any editor,input field etc.

# FYI

I have made the assistant snoop dogg. You can change the prompt to be whomever you like, and give it personality as you like (or lack thereof).
